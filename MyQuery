|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. (LOOKS AT INDEX CARD) We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including "Bible Bafflers", "Satan's Boners," "Good Grief! More Satan's Boners" and, for the teens, "It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."|First Church of Springfield|
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?                                                                                                                                                                     |First Church of Springfield|
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Sit down, Homer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |First Church of Springfield|
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (LOOKS AT ANOTHER CARD) Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It's psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread...                                                                                                     |First Church of Springfield|
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: ... or those just in need of a tune-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |First Church of Springfield|
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |First Church of Springfield|
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |CHURCH FOYER               |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (PATTING HOMER ON THE SHOULDER) We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage (CHUCKLE) won't be the one that got away.                                                                                                                                                                                 |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don't we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they're here. (TO COUPLE) John... Gloria?                                                                                                                            |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Thank you, Gloria. John, why don't you tell us a little about why you're here?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: You've come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other's eyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here?                                                                                                                                                                       |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev.

|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Come on, Homer. What are her faults?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |Retreat Cabin              |
|Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Okay. Marge?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |Retreat Cabin              |
|Marge Simpson: Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |Retreat Cabin              |
